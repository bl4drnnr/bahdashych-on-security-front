I used to think that it's something unreal complicated and dangerous since your mistake can destroy literally everything, but then I tried, and you know, it sounds much scary then it is in really. The only thing you need to do is to start from the basics.",

Therefore, the only thing you really want is to as fast as possible deploy your application in a more or less secure way.",

    "Nginx (pronounced 'engine-x') is a high-performance, open-source web server. It is a reverse proxy server, which means it is designed to pass incoming requests from clients to other servers for further processing. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as serving static files, proxying requests to a backend server, or handling SSL encryption.",
    "Nginx is known for its stability, robustness, and low resource usage, making it a popular choice for web administrators and hosting providers. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it well-suited for high-traffic websites and web applications. It also has a wide range of features and configuration options, including load balancing, caching, and access control.",
    "In addition to its use as a web server, Nginx can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. This versatility, combined with its performance and stability, has made Nginx a popular choice among web developers and system administrators.",
    "Overall, Nginx is a powerful and flexible web server that is well-suited for a wide range of applications and use cases. Whether you are serving a simple website, running a large web application, or anything in between, Nginx is a great choice for your needs.",

These certificates are used to secure web traffic and ensure that sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, are transmitted securely over the internet.",
    "The main goal of Let's Encrypt is to make encryption more accessible to the general public by offering free and easy-to-use certificates. Prior to Let's Encrypt, obtaining a certificate could be a complicated and expensive process. With Let's Encrypt, anyone can obtain a certificate with just a few clicks, making it possible to secure a website or web application with minimal effort.",
    "Let's Encrypt is also notable for its automated certificate issuance and renewal process. This means that once you have obtained a certificate, you don't need to worry about manually renewing it in the future. The certificate will automatically renew itself as long as the domain remains active and under your control.",
