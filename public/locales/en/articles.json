I used to think that it's something unreal completed and dangerous since your mistake can destroy literally everything, but then I tried, and you know, it sounds much scary then it is in really. The only thing you need to do is to start from the basics.",

It is a reverse proxy server, which means it is designed to pass incoming requests from clients to other servers for further processing. This can be useful in a variety of situations, such as serving static files, proxying requests to a backend server, or handling SSL encryption.",
      "p5": "Nginx is known for its stability, robustness, and low resource usage, making it a popular choice for web administrators and hosting providers. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections, making it well-suited for high-traffic websites and web applications. It also has a wide range of features and configuration options, including load balancing, caching, and access control.",
      "p6": "In addition to its use as a web server, Nginx can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. This versatility, combined with its performance and stability, has made Nginx a popular choice among web developers and system administrators.",
      "p7": "Overall, Nginx is a powerful and flexible web server that is well-suited for a wide range of applications and use cases. Whether you are serving a simple website, running a large web application, or anything in between, Nginx is a great choice for your needs.",

      "p21": "The main goal of Let's Encrypt is to make encryption more accessible to the general public by offering free and easy-to-use certificates.
